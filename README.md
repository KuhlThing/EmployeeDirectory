### App deployed on Heroku:  
(https://employee-directory-pm.herokuapp.com/)

As an employer, I need to be able to view a directory of my employees so that I have ready access to non-sensitive information.  
  
This is an employee directory created with React. This app's UI is broken into components and responds to user events.

The directory can be filtered by typing a name in the filter field. Each column can be sorted by clicking on the column header.

API used to populate table is randomuser.me
